The classic of classic the ToDo application. This time I made in in HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

## My process
1. HTML 
2. CSS 
3. JavaScript 

### Built with
- HTML
- Aria
- CSS custom properties
- CSS Grid
- Flexbox
- JavaScript local storage
- Dom manipulation en Data

### Choices
 - Used Rem and em most of the time instead of hard coding pixels
 - Aria for accessibility
 - custom properties to specify color and size.
 - Local storage for array data
 - event listeners with data


### Learnings
 - Box shadow and opacity are really powerfull
 - css grid and flexbox are both easy to use and implement.
 - CSS duplication of code gives me the shivers
 - Easy animations with transition and transform
